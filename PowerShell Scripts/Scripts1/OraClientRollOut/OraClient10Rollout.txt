Updating to Oracle client 10.0 on Meps computers

1. Get a list of computer names for the Editorial and Graphics department
	A. Get all AD computers by running this script; \\malibu\it\NTServers\Scripts\OraClientRollOut\ADPC2User.ps1
	   This script will output a list of computers with the last login to C:\workdir\meps\ADPC2User20080804025003.log. The
	   actual name of the log depends on the date.
	   
	B. Depending on the department, run GetGraphicsMembers.ps1 to get a list of everyone in the graphics department. This will
	   give you the account name for each user in the graphics department. For graphics, look in 
	   \\malibu\it\NTServers\Scripts\OraClientRollOut\Graphics and for Editorial, look in 
	   \\malibu\it\NTServers\Scripts\OraClientRollOut\Editorial. Be sure to open each script and modify paths to match your
	   desired output.
	   
	C. Attach a computer name to a user by launching \\malibu\it\NTServers\Scripts\OraClientRollOut\Graphics\get-Graphicspc.ps1
	   or  \\malibu\it\NTServers\Scripts\OraClientRollOut\get-Editorialpc.ps1. This script will link the account name from
	   B. to a computer name from step A. The comuter name will then be outputed. Verify desired paths prior to running this script
	   
2. Now that you have computer names, verify that the computer has not already been updated with the oracle client.
	A. Run GetOraclePaths.ps1. This script should point at the file that contains a list of the computers from C. of step 1.
	If the computer already has a path that begins with; P:\OracleClient\10.2.0\rt1\bin. Then you will not add this computer
	to the list of computers to get the oracle update. If the path is not as listed above, add the computer to the list at
	\\malibu\it\Oracle\InstallLogs\oranetinstall.txt

3. Run the update script
	A. Prior to running the update script, open the script and verify the paths. The script is located at;
	   \\malibu\it\NTServers\Scripts\OraclientNetReg1.ps1. The script should point to the location above;
	   \\malibu\it\Oracle\InstallLogs\oranetinstall.txt
 	B. After the install has completed, look at the log to verify all computers were updated. The log will have the date of the
 	   install and is located at \\malibu\it\Oracle\InstallLogs
