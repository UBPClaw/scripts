MonthEnd Process

1. Resynch the before volume with the main CIS_DG via A Scheduled task called MonthEnd_Resync_SnapShot_Before, which
   runs at 4:00 AM the day of the month end process. 
   The scheduled task runs E:\Scripts\MonthEnd\MonthEnd_Resync_SnapShot_Before.cmd. After the volume is synchronized,
   an email will be sent 
2. 


1. Scheduled task
2. Resynch Before Volume
3. Email CIS Programmer to begin Month End
4. Scheduled task waiting for the monthend.txt file
5. Bat file runs to stop services
6. Create Before Volume
7. Start services
8. Look to see if the X drive on XLR exists (Before volume)
9. Email Sys Admin and CIS programmer if the X dirve on XLR (Before Volume) is there.
End

Troubleshooting

A couple of encountered issues:

1. Normal Day end snap shots for before, or after have failed. 
2. Month End Snap Shot for the before volume has failed for 2 month end periods in a row.


*****Normal Day ENd Snap Shot fails
1. This is usualy caused by the VSS Service (Volume Shadow Copy Service)
   You will be sent a page stating the Before/after snap shot failed. The Snapshot is
   usually stuck in between(Snapped deported, but not imported on the standby server) If
   this is the case, you will see Blue explanation point

Here's how to force the snapshot:

1. Open Veritas Enterprise Administrator
2. Expand Local Host
3. Verify that you see blue explanation points, and not red X's. If you see Red
   X's, then see the Month End Snap Shot Failure section.
4. If the Before snapshot failed, navigate to E:\Scripts and launch Create_SnapShot_Before.cmd
   If the After snapshot failed, navigate to E:\Scripts and launch Create_SnapShot_After.cmd
   You can see the results at c:\Create_SnapShot_After.log or Create_SnapShot_Before.log
5. If the explanation points go away, and you see the volume on XLR, then you fixed it
   If the explanation points did not go away, then go to services and stop/start 
   Veritas VSS provider, and repeat step 4.
6. If the blue explanation point does not go away, then repeat step 5, and then run:
    If Before volume is the issue.  e:\scripts\Resync_SnapShot_Before.cmd
    If After volume is the issue.  e:\scripts\Resync_SnapShot_After.cmd
   If Step 6 worked, then manualy snap the desired volume by:
    Before volume: E:\scripts\Create_SnapShot_Before.cmd
    After Volume:  E:\scripts\Create_SnapShot_After.cmd
   If Step 6 did not work, and you still see the blue explanation points do this
 

Before Volume Failure From the command line
   
   1. psexec \\xlr vxdg -g CIS_Before -f deport>>C:\Resync_SnapShot_Before.log
   2. vxassist rescan
   3. vxdg -g CIS_Before -f -C import
   4. psexec \\xlr vxassist rescan
   5. vxdg -g CIS_Before -n CIS_DG -C -f join
   6. vxassist -f -gCIS_DG snapback volume1

After Volume Failure From the command line
   
   1. psexec \\xlr vxdg -g CIS_After -f deport
   2. vxassist rescan
   3. vxdg -g CIS_After -f -C import
   4. psexec \\xlr vxassist rescan
   5. vxdg -g CIS_After -n CIS_DG -C -f join
   6. vxassist -f -gCIS_DG snapback volume1
 
If the above steps fail to resolve the issue, then open a ticket with Veritas 

*****End Normal Day End Troubleshooting

*****Month End SnapShot Failure

Most likely, the Red X indicates a problem with a disk. In the past the problems has
been with the EMC disks. RDP to the Lotus server, locate the the ECC console icon on the 
dekstop, and double click it. When the Gui interface comes up, click on the submit button.
Enter the correct user name and password stored as EMC Switch & Control Center in 
Password agent. use the Emc Control Center username and password. Once the console pops up,
Look at the alerts. If there is an EMC disk problem, it will be displayed in the alert
console.




If there are problems with the EMC disks, give EMC a call.

After the problem with the disks have been fixed. 

1. From Eagle/XLR (CIS_DG on line Cluster Server), launch  Veritas Enterprise Administrator
2. Click Actions and select Rescan.
3. The Read Xs should go away.
4. Follow steps 1-6 of forcing a volume snapshot listed above.
