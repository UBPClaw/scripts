**Scripts located at I:\NTServers\Scripts\NetApp\MonthlyDataUpdate**

The Goal is to present a volume to Hosting and to Colo. So, we are taking the existing volume with the monthly web data

Each month, we create a new snapshot and create a new flexclone for the monthly split (Odd or Even)


Monthly Data Process

-Delete share \\ranger\Data_Previous though Computer Management

-Delete volume ranger_dp_previous in FilerView on M45

-Rename the either ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd to ranger_dp_previous(if the month is even rename ranger_dp_even and if the month is odd rename ranger_dp_odd) (Ex: If the current month is January to be deployed, the previous would be November, so rename November to be ranger_dp_previous, Jan becomes to new ranger_dp_odd)

-Create share \\ranger\Data_Previous pointing at C:\vol\ranger_dp_previous\dp\DataProcess\Data (Administrators Full Control, Everyone Read)

-Create Snapshot off of ranger_dp_fc M45 FilerView>Volumes>Snapshots>Add Select ranger_dp_fc for the volume, Snapshot Name: either ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd,click add

-Create Flexclone using the snapshot ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd,flexClone Volumes>create,next,FlexClone Name: either ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd,Parent Volume: ranger_dp_fc,space guarantee:none,next,Parent Volme Snapshot:either ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd,next,commit,close

-Manage Flexclone, check next to either ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd, click Split Start,click OK 

-- WAIT: (Takes about 16 hours, to check status ssh to m45 and run "vol clone split status")

-Reduce size of the volume currently 375GB (300GB + 20%) M45>FilerView>Volumes>Manage>click on either ranger_dp_even or ranger_dp_odd>Resize -Storage>Next>Space Guarantee = None>Click Usable> Change to 375 GB>SnapShot Reserve = 0>Click Next>Click Commit>Click Close.

-Multi-store>Manage Vfilers>ranger>Uncheck Configure vfiler ranger>Next>Add to Additional Paths "/vol/ranger_dp_xxxx">Next>Modify Vfiler>Next>Close

-Update Ranger share - Open Computer Manager from workstation and connect to "RANGER">System Tools>Shared Folders>Shares>Change folder path for "Data_Next" to "C:\vol\ranger_dp_XXXX\dp\DataProcess\Data" > Administrators Full; others read>Finish
 
-Delete Snapshot that was created on ranger_dp_fc - Volumes>Snapshots>Manage>Select from 'View Volume' dropdown menu "Ranger_dp_fc">View button> Check "ranger_dp_XXXX">Delete - 

-- WAIT: (Til data has been approved by QA/Editoral) 

:: For Poway Hosting ::
-(If volume does not exist) Create volume on destination that is the same size as the volume that is going to be mirrored
-Restrict the volume>NetApp System -Manager>M35>Storage>Volumes>Vfs02_xxxx_fc>Status>restrict

(Through GUI otherwise use commandline/putty)
-SnapMirror/Add select Destination Volume, Next
			 Enter Source Filer and Source Location (Example: M45, ranger_dp_odd), Next
			 Accept defaults, Next
			 Select Use Custom Schedule and enter - - - -(Spaces between the dashes), Next
			 Commit
			 Close



(Commandline/Putty)
-Open Putty for M35 "snapmirror initialize -S M45:ranger_dp_even M35:vfs02_even_fc"  (Until GUI is fixed on M35)
	To check status type "snapmirror status" (When state is "Snapmirrored", the mirror is complete.)

(GUI)
-SnapMirror/Manage click Advanced on the SnapMirror Entry that was created
			 Initialize
			 OK

-- WAIT: an hour or so, check using "snapmirror status"

			 

- When Synch is complete SnapMirror/Manage click Advanced on the SnapMirror Entry that was created
			 Click Quiesce
				 :: via ssh comands "snapmirror quiesce vfs02_even_fc" or "snapmirror quiesce vfs02_odd_fc"
			 Click Break
				 :: via ssh commands "snapmirror break vfs02_even_fc" or "snapmirror break vfs02_odd_fc"

-Add volume to vfiler via ssh
			 vfiler add vfs02 /vol/vfs02_even_fc or vfiler add vfs02 /vol/vfs02_odd_fc
